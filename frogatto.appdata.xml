    <p>
      An old-school 2D platform game, starring a certain quixotic frog. 
      Frogatto has gorgeous, high-end pixel art, pumping arcade tunes, and
      all the gameplay nuance of a classic console title. Run and jump over
      pits and enemies. Grab enemies with your tongue, swallow them, and then
      spit them out at other enemies as projectiles! Fight dangerous bosses,
      and solve vexing puzzles. Collect coins and use them to buy upgrades
      and new abilities in the store. Talk to characters in game, and work
      to unravel Big Bad Milgram's plot against the townsfolk!
